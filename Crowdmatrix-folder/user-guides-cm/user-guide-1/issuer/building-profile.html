            <h3 class="header-two i-p-t">Write for Investors</h3>
            <p>Make sure all your content is geared towards investors and not customers! Frame everything your write around what investors want to know, and what's valuable from an investment perspective.</p>
          
            <h3 class="header-two i-p-t">UTILIZE & TWEAK EXISTING ASSETS </h3>
            <p>Collect all your business documents - pitch decks, marketing copy etc. The important thing is you make the neccesary changes to gear them towards investors and your raise on Crowdmatrix.</p>
          
            <h3 class="header-two i-p-t">ENGAGE & CONVERT</h3>
            <p>It's your responsibility to create a deal profile that engages and excites investors. You need to ensure that you are converting visitors to your deal page into investors in your company.</p>

   <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>Give a brief, capturing introduction of your company. This is an important section since the text will be the first thing an investor reads on your company profile and your overview will be used in your company tombstone and in emails that are sent out to investors. Keep it short, 2-3 sentences.</p>

          <p class="p-p-t">The rest of the section headers are customizable. You should think critically about what are the most important points about your company and your deal that you want investors to know about and then use the 3 sections to highlight those points.</p>
